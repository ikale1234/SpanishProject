# Learning Spanish

This is a repository that consists of different programs to take information about spanish terms and use it to create different games.

## verborganizer.py

This program takes text files from a folder with spanish termsand uses the info in those files to create a database full of spanish info. I used this as a module I imported and used in other games.

## conjugation.py

This is a multiple choice game that tests specific conjugations of a spanish term

## spanishvocab.py

This is a multiple choice game that tests the user on various spanish vocabulary, but not conjugations of verbs

## E.T.C

Everything else is currently a work in progress
